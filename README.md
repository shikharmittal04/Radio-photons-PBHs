# Background of radio photons from primordial black holes
If you use these codes please consider citing https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac005 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11975).

There are two codes: one for evaporating PBHs and one for accreting PBHs. The code 'Evaporation.py' requires the photon flux generated by the `C` code [`BlackHawk`](https://blackhawk.hepforge.org/). One example file is provided for a 10<sup>25</sup> kg mass PBH: `flux.npy` which is the quantity F<sub>M</sub> (see equation 4 in paper) in units of GeV<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. These values correspond to energies in `E.npy` in units of GeV.
